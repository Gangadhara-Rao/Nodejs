 
Buffers:
 
    -> Temporary storage spot for a chunk of data that is being transferred from one place to another.
 
    -> The buffer is filled with data, then passed along.
 
    -> Transfer small chunks of data at a time.
 
                              BUFFER
    Data Passed On <--------- |||||| <--|-- DATA.
 
-> Buffer is nothing but it diviedes the collection data into small chunks.
 
Stream: It is a flow of data.
 
        -> In node js, the data will flow like chunks and those chunks will store in buffer and finally that buffer will share the data.
 
        -> Can create strean in node js to transfer data.
 
        -> It will increase the performance.
 
-> Streams are 3 types:
 
    - Writable streams: allow node js to write data to a stream.
 
    - Readable streams: allow node js to read data from a stream.
 
    - Duplex: can read and write to a stream.
 
-> Pipes: The data is coverted into small chunks and sends into buffer. After that pipes are useful to write the stream automatically.
 
-> Pipes can move from read to write. But, not vice versa.

    -> POST: app.post('route', fn)
 
    -> DELETE: app.delete('route', fn)

Template Engines: Its is used to create an HTML template with minimal code.
 
-> Ex: EJS => Embedded JavaScript template engine.
